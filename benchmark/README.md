# Benchmarking
We used 50 images from the kitti dataset to benchmark the models.

## Caffe
```python
cd caffe
python benchmark_caffe.py
```

## Tensorflow
```python
cd tensorflow
python tf_object_detection.py
```
## Note
The results of our findings are mentioned [here](https://github.com/4rshdeep/detection_hardware_characterization/blob/master/benchmark/timings.txt)
